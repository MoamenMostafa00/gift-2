            person like you, You've helped me countless times and you've listened to me ramble on about absolutely
            anything, Whether it's something I'm struggling with or a problem i need support with or what to do or even
            just random stuff, And most of all you've given me support when you absolutely needed all the support in the
            world which literally means the world to me. Thank you for being the amazing person you are, genuinely
            you're one of the most interesting people I've met over the past couple of years, I'm looking forward to
